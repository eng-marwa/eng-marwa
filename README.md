<h2>Hey! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
I'm Marwa! Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I'm constantly tinkering with code and building cool stuff!

ðŸ”­ I'm passionate about Java and Kotlin for Java and Kotlin for Android app development while diving deep into Dart and Flutter for cross-platform mobile development. I'm also  passionate about Spring Framework, and Spring Boot

ðŸŒ±I am interested in advanced object-oriented programming concepts and applying SOLID principles to my projects.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Android development, Flutter apps, or Spring Boot web applications.
